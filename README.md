# test_probot_ug
A demo repo created to test probot app v1 

I have created a probot demo app and registered it on this repo. Whenever any event is emitted by github on this repo, a trigger is made to the "demo probot app" that listens to the event (awaits) and responds. The demo probot app is hosted on glitch.
